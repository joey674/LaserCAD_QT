- Supports grouped objects and combined shapes for complex patterns.
- Layer management for organized and efficient design.

### Multi-Command Laser Configuration
- Configure multiple laser commands for different shapes or paths.
- Supports custom parameters such as power, speed, frequency, pulse width, and so on.
- Assign distinct laser settings to different layers or objects.
- Preview and validate laser paths before execution.

###  Multi-Axis Motion System Support
- Compatible with various high-precision motion axes and positioning systems.
- Flexible device adapter layer for easy integration of new hardware.
- Supports synchronized control between laser output and motion systems.
- Real-time monitoring of axis position and system status.

### Highly Customizable Command System
- Define your own laser commands and execution sequences.
- Fully scriptable workflows for automation.
- Optimized for both high-speed marking and ultra-fine precision work.
